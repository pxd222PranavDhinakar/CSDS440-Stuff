This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook and accompanying documentation for the CSDS 440 Machine Learning Programming 2 assignment. The notebook provides a practical application of machine learning concepts using Python. For this assignment, we will implement and evaluate (i) na√Øve Bayes and (ii) logistic regression. 

## Overview

This assignment presents a comprehensive analysis of how non-independent features within datasets affect the performance of Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression classifiers. It aims to challenge the conventional wisdom regarding the sensitivity of these classifiers to feature dependencies.s
