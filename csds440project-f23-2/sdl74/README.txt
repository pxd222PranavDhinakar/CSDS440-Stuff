First, install scikit-learn with pip install scikit-learn
if not already installed, install numpy with pip install numpy
Open the file experiments.ipynb and run all the blocks in order. This should reproduce the data I got in my data section of the report
the numTrials variable has been changed from 30 to 5 to increase runtime, if you would like to more faithfully recreate the data, you can set this back to 30 in the jupyter notebook
