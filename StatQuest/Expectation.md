$$
\begin{align*}
 \frac{No. Heard ofTroll}{Total} = \frac{37}{213}=0.17\\

The *probability* that a randomly selected person in StatLand has heard of Troll 2 is 0.17, which is relatively low. 
Probability Heard of: $0.17$

The *probability* that a randomly selected person in StatLand has not heard of Troll 2 is 0.83 which is relatively high.
Probability Not Heard of: $0.83$

StatSquatch bets $1 that the next person we meet has heard of the movie Troll 2

We can use these probabilities to decide whether or not we should agree to the bet. 

|             | Heard | Not Heard |

| Probability | 0.17  | 0.83      |
| Outcome     |   -$1    |     +$1      |

We have decided to make this bet 100 times. 

We expect to lose the bet, 17 times in the course of the 100 bets. 
$0.17 \times 100 = 17 \ losses$ 

This term represents how much money we expect to lose in 100 bets:
$(0.17 \times 100) \times -1 = -17 \ dollars$ 

This term represents how much money we expect to win in 100 bets:
$(0.83 \times 100) \times 1 = 83 \ dollars$ 

We can add the two terms together to find out the total of how much we expect to win or lose.
$((0.17 \times 100) \times -1) + ((0.83 \times 100) \times 1) = 66 \ dollars$

We can also calculate the *expected* average amount of money we will gain *per* bet by dividing everything by the number of bets, 100

$E(X) = \frac{((0.17 \times 100) \times -1) + ((0.83 \times 100) \times 1)}{100} = \frac{66}{100} = \$0.66$


$E(X) = \frac{((0.17 \times \cancel{100}) \times -1) + ((0.83 \times \cancel{100}) \times 1)}{\cancel{100}}$

$E(X) = (0.17 \times -1) + (0.83 \times 1) = 0.66 = \sum\limits xP(X=x)$
$x$ = Specific outcome: $-\$1$ or $+\$1$ 
$P(X=x)$ = The probability of observing that specific outcome: $0.17$ or $0.83$
