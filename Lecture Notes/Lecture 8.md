*Overview*
• The c____ t____ tracks four kinds of results the t___ p___, t___ n___, f_ p____ and f___ n____
- What is accuracy? • What are the weaknesses of accuracy as a metric? (i) (ii) (iii) 
- What is weighted accuracy? Why is it used? • What is precision? Recall? Why are these used? 
- What is specificity? Sensitivity? The F1 score? 
- What is a learning curve? Why is this useful? 
- When the algorithm produces a confidence, we can draw ___ - __ graphs or ___ ___ ___ graphs. 
- To do this we move a t____ down the list of c___ At each point, examples with confidence h____ than the t____ are classified p___, and the rest classified n___. Then we compute the metrics at this threshold. 
• ROC graphs are m______ i___. Also, random classifiers have ROC graphs that are d___. 
• We often use a____ u____ r____ as a comparison statistic. However, ROC graphs can be misleading if the ___

Functions
- A function maps input(s) into output(s)
- Usually denoted: $f: X \rightarrow Y; f(x)-y$

Example: $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
$f(x) - x^{2}$

Multivariate Functions
- A function can have multiple inputs, denoted by $f: A \times B \times \dots \rightarrow Y$
- the $"\times"$ is the "Cartesian Product" or "Cross product": all possible tuples
- Example: $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$


Vector Functions:
- A function can also have multiple outputs, denoted by $f: X \rightarrow A \times B \times \dots$
- Example: $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2}, f(x) - x$
